## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Through this project, I practiced:

Creating a simple QR code component layout using Flexbox for centering and alignment.

Applying custom CSS for visual design, including box shadows, rounded corners, and typography.

Enhancing accessibility with semantic HTML and appropriate alt attributes for images.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code to frontendmentor.io" />
```
```css
body {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to refine my skills in:

Mobile-first design and creating responsive layouts that adapt well across devices.

Using modern CSS features like Grid and Flexbox to create more complex layouts.

Implementing more interactive elements using JavaScript, such as QR code scanning or dynamic content.


### Useful resources
